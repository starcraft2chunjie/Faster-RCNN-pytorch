# Interface for accessing the Microsoft COCO dataset.

# Microsoft COCO is a large image dataset designed for object detection,
# segmentation, and caption generation. pycocotools is a Python API that
# assists in loading, parsing and visualizing the annotations in COCO.
# Please visit http://mscoco.org/ for more information on COCO, including
# for the data, paper, and tutorials. The exact format of the annotations
# is also described on the COCO website. For example usage of the pycocotools
# please see pycocotools_demo.ipynb. In addition to this API, please download both
# the COCO images and annotations in order to run the demo.

# An alternative to using the API is to load the annotations directly
# into Python dictionary
# Using the API provides additional utility functions. Note that this API
# supports both *instance* and *caption* annotations. In the case of
# captions not all functions are defined (e.g. categories are undefined).

# The following API functions are defined:
#  COCO       - COCO api class that loads COCO annotation file and prepare data structures.
#  decodeMask - Decode binary mask M encoded via run-length encoding.
#  encodeMask - Encode binary mask M using run-length encoding.
#  getAnnIds  - Get ann ids that satisfy given filter conditions.
#  getCatIds  - Get cat ids that satisfy given filter conditions.
#  getImgIds  - Get img ids that satisfy given filter conditions.
#  loadAnns   - Load anns with the specified ids.
#  loadCats   - Load cats with the specified ids.
#  loadImgs   - Load imgs with the specified ids.
#  segToMask  - Convert polygon segmentation to binary mask.
#  showAnns   - Display the specified annotations.
#  loadRes    - Load algorithm results and create API for accessing them.
#  download   - Download COCO images from mscoco.org server.
# Throughout the API "ann"=annotation, "cat"=category, and "img"=image.
# Help on each functions can be accessed by: "help COCO>function".
